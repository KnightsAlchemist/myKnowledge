### **What is a Language Model?**

A **language model** is a computational model that understands and generates human language. It assigns probabilities to sequences of words, effectively predicting the next word in a sentence given the preceding words. This capability allows it to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.

### **What Makes a Language Model "Large"?**

A language model becomes "large" when it has a vast number of parametersâ€”often billions or even trillions. Parameters are the weights and biases within the neural network that the model learns during training. The more parameters a model has, the more complex patterns it can capture, enabling it to understand and generate more nuanced and sophisticated text.
