The No-GAN (Non-Adversarial GAN) method generates synthetic data without the adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator, which is central to traditional GANs. Instead, it uses simpler techniques like direct optimization, autoencoders, or noise-based sampling to produce synthetic data. This approach reduces training complexity and instability while still creating realistic data, but often at the cost of generating less diverse or lower-quality results compared to adversarial methods.
