If you’re using Linux on both laptops, connecting and transferring data using a USB-C to USB-C cable is straightforward and can be quite efficient. Here's how you can proceed:

### **1. Using USB-C Networking:**

Most modern Linux distributions support USB-C networking, allowing you to connect two devices directly and transfer data as if they were connected via Ethernet.

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Connect the Laptops:**
   - Use a USB-C to USB-C cable to connect the two laptops.

2. **Check for Network Interface Recognition:**
   - Open a terminal on both laptops and run the following command to check if a new network interface has been created:
     ```bash
     ip a
     ```
   - You should see a new interface, typically named `usb0` or something similar.

3. **Configure IP Addresses:**
   - Assign static IP addresses to both interfaces. For example:
     - On **Laptop 1**:
       ```bash
       sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.1/24 dev usb0
       sudo ip link set usb0 up
       ```
     - On **Laptop 2**:
       ```bash
       sudo ip addr add 192.168.100.2/24 dev usb0
       sudo ip link set usb0 up
       ```

4. **Test the Connection:**
   - Ping one laptop from the other to check if they can communicate:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.100.2  # From Laptop 1
     ping 192.168.100.1  # From Laptop 2
     ```
   - If the pings succeed, the connection is established.

5. **Transfer Files Using SCP or rsync:**
   - Now, you can transfer files using `scp` (Secure Copy) or `rsync`:
     - Using `scp`:
       ```bash
       scp /path/to/file username@192.168.100.2:/path/to/destination
       ```
     - Using `rsync`:
       ```bash
       rsync -avz /path/to/folder username@192.168.100.2:/path/to/destination
       ```

### **2. Using SSH File Sharing:**

You can set up an SSH server on one laptop and use it as an access point for transferring files.

#### **Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Install OpenSSH Server on Both Laptops:**
   - On Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openssh-server
     ```
   - On Fedora/Red Hat-based systems:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf install openssh-server
     ```

2. **Start the SSH Service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   sudo systemctl enable ssh
   ```

3. **Transfer Files:**
   - Use `scp` or `rsync` as described above to transfer files over the SSH connection.

### **3. Using Samba or NFS (Network File Sharing):**

If you want a more graphical or persistent connection, you can use Samba (for Windows-compatible sharing) or NFS (Network File System).

#### **For Samba:**

1. Install Samba on both laptops:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install samba  # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install samba  # Fedora
   ```

2. Edit the Samba configuration file (`/etc/samba/smb.conf`) and add a share section:

```ini
   [SharedFolder]
       path = /home/username/shared
       available = yes
       valid users = username
       read only = no
       browsable = yes
       public = yes
       writable = yes
   ```

3. Restart Samba:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart smbd
   ```

4. Access the share from the other laptop using a file manager or the `smbclient` tool.

#### **For NFS:**

1. Install NFS on both laptops:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server  # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo dnf install nfs-utils          # Fedora
   ```

2. Edit the `/etc/exports` file on the server laptop to define shared directories:
   ```
   /home/username/shared 192.168.100.2(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
   ```

3. Restart the NFS service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nfs-server
   ```

4. Mount the shared directory on the client laptop:
   ```bash
   sudo mount 192.168.100.1:/home/username/shared /mnt
   ```

### **Which Method to Choose?**

- **USB-C Networking + SCP/rsync:** This is the most straightforward and versatile method, allowing direct file transfer without any extra software setup.
- **SSH File Transfer:** Offers secure transfer and works well if you’re comfortable using the terminal.
- **Samba or NFS:** Suitable if you want a more user-friendly, GUI-accessible solution or persistent shared folders.

All these methods should work smoothly on Linux, giving you multiple ways to transfer files efficiently between your two laptops over a USB-C connection.
