Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller, meaningful units called **tokens**. These tokens are the building blocks used by machine learning models, [[natural language processing]] (NLP) systems, and text-based AI to analyze and process textual data. Tokenization is a crucial step in converting raw text into a format that algorithms can understand and process.

### Types of Tokenization:

1. **[[Word Tokenization]]**:
    
    - Breaks text into individual words. For example, the sentence "I love programming" would be tokenized as `["I", "love", "programming"]`.
    - Common in tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and text classification.
    - May face issues with punctuation or compound words (e.g., "it's" might become "it" and "'s", which could impact meaning).

2. **[[Subword Tokenization]]**:
    
    - Breaks text into smaller units, often subwords or character-level tokens, particularly useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words or morphologically complex languages.
    - Algorithms like **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** and **WordPiece** are common for this.
    - For example, the word "programming" might be tokenized into subwords like `["pro", "gram", "ming"]`, allowing the model to handle unseen or rare words by learning patterns in subwords.
3. **[[Character Tokenization]]**:
    
    - Breaks text into individual characters. For example, "love" becomes `["l", "o", "v", "e"]`.
    - Used in models dealing with languages with complex morphology, or in cases where fine-grained detail is needed.
    - While effective for certain tasks, character tokenization can be computationally expensive due to the longer sequences produced.

### Tokenization in NLP and Machine Learning:

1. **[[Bag of Words]] (BoW)**:
    
    - Tokenization plays a role in this model where each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies or occurrences.
    - Simple and widely used in early NLP applications but does not capture word order or semantic meaning.
2. **[[N-gram Tokenization]]**:
    
    - Instead of single words or characters, tokenization is done in sequences of `n` words (or characters). For example, for `n=2`, the sentence "I love programming" becomes bigrams: `["I love", "love programming"]`.
    - N-grams are useful for capturing context, but larger `n` values may increase sparsity and model complexity.
3. **Tokenization in [[Transformers]]**:
    
    - Modern language models like BERT and GPT use subword tokenization techniques (e.g., **WordPiece**, **BPE**, or **Unigram Tokenization**) to handle large vocabularies and unknown words more efficiently.
    - These methods create a balance between memory efficiency (fewer unique tokens) and the ability to handle a wide range of text inputs.
    - Special tokens like `[CLS]`, `[SEP]`, or `[PAD]` are introduced for handling tasks such as sentence classification, separating sequences, and padding inputs to uniform lengths.
4. **[[Token Embeddings]]**:
    
    - After [[Tokenization]], each token is converted into a numerical representation or **embedding** that can be processed by machine learning models.
    - Pre-trained models like **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, or **FastText** map tokens to continuous vector spaces where similar tokens are closer together.
    - In [[Deep Learning]], [[Transformers]] use **contextual embeddings**, where the meaning of a [[token]] is influenced by its surrounding context, enhancing model performance in tasks like language understanding and generation.

### Challenges in Tokenization:

1. **Ambiguity and Homographs**:
    
    - Tokenization can struggle with ambiguous words or homographs (words that are spelled the same but have different meanings), especially in languages with rich morphology or polysemy (e.g., “bank” can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river).
2. **Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) Words**:
    
    - Traditional word-based tokenization methods face difficulty with rare or unknown words that weren't present in the training data.
    - Subword tokenization helps alleviate this issue by breaking down OOV words into known components.
3. **Language-Specific Tokenization**:
    
    - Some languages, like Chinese or Japanese, don't use spaces to separate words, making tokenization more complex and requiring language-specific tokenization methods like **segmentation** algorithms.
    - Agglutinating languages (e.g., Finnish, Turkish) may have long compound words that need special treatment in tokenization.

### Popular Tokenization Algorithms and Libraries:

1. **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)**:
    
    - An iterative subword tokenization method that starts with individual characters and merges the most frequent pairs of symbols until a desired vocabulary size is reached. Used in models like GPT and OpenAI’s tokenization.
2. **WordPiece**:
    
    - Similar to BPE but used in BERT, where tokenization prioritizes encoding common subwords and ensures efficient handling of both frequent and rare words.
3. **Unigram Language Model**:
    
    - Used by models like **XLNet** and **SentencePiece**, it learns a probabilistic model over the subwords and allows flexibility in segmenting words based on likelihood.
4. **Libraries**:
    
    - **[[NLTK]] (Natural Language Toolkit)**: A popular Python library for tokenization in NLP tasks, offering word, sentence, and character tokenization methods.
    - **[[SpaCy]]**: A fast NLP library with built-in tokenizers for different languages, optimized for production use.
    - **[[Hugging Face Tokenizers]]**: Provides efficient tokenization (subword and word-based) optimized for deep learning models, supporting transformers and BERT-like architectures.

### Applications of Tokenization:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Tokenization enables models to analyze customer feedback, reviews, and other text to determine sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral).
2. **Machine Translation**: Tokenization is the first step in breaking down sentences for translating between languages, ensuring that words and subwords are properly interpreted.
3. **Text Summarization**: Models use tokenized inputs to generate concise summaries of larger documents or articles.
4. **Question Answering**: Tokenization helps break down queries and documents so that models can focus on relevant portions of the text to generate accurate answers.

Tokenization is an essential preprocessing step in most NLP and machine learning tasks, transforming raw text into a structured form that models can process and analyze.
