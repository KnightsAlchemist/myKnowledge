High cardinality in data refers to a feature or column that contains a large number of unique values, such as user IDs, IP addresses, or product codes. This can make analysis, modeling, and storage more difficult due to memory constraints and reduced model interpretability.

To deal with high cardinality:

1. **Feature hashing**: Convert categorical variables into fixed-size numerical vectors.
2. **Dimensionality reduction**: Apply techniques like PCA or clustering to group similar values.
3. **Encoding methods**: Use target encoding, frequency encoding, or embeddings (in deep learning) instead of one-hot encoding, which can explode the feature space.
4. **Binning**: Group rare or less frequent categories into a common bin.
